Error Metrics, We calculate our error metrics in a different way than convention. We always subtract the observed value from the model value such that under-predictions are negative and over-predictions are positive., , , 
Onset Peak Flux, Onset Peak is the peak that is typically found just after the initial increase in particle flux., Onset peak is found via an algorithm that uses the following steps: Fit the time profile using a Weibull function and find the global maximum of the fit. Take second derivative of Weibull and find the global minimum. Find the peak flux between the found max and min from the previous steps., , 
Max Peak Flux, Max Peak is the maximum flux value in the time profile. Can be associated with ESP peak but not necessarily so., , ,
