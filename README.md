# sphinxval
SPHINX validation code for solar energetic particle models

This SPHINX code is not associated with sphinx-doc, the automated documentation building code.

SPHINX is developed via community challenges through the SHINE, ISWAT, ESWW, and SEPVAL conferences and in support of the SEP Scoreboards.

Reminder to Windows users: change your system PYTHONPATH environment variable such that your `.../sphinxval/` directory is included.
